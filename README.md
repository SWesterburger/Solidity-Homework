## Smart Contracts with Solidity ##

**Summary**
Your new startup has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions, and the team wants to build smart contracts to automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!
Fortunately, you've been learning how to program smart contracts with Solidity! What you will be doing this assignment is creating a few ProfitSplitter contracts. These contracts will do several things:


1) Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.

2) Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.

3) Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically

All smart contracts are built with Solidity in RemixIDE. First we tested the smartcontracts on a local blockchain created with Ganache. After initial testing the contracts were deployed on the Kovan testnetwork.
